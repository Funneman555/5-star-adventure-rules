Advantage is an  resource that adds a d6 to the relevant roll, be it for [[The Game!/Skills\|Skills]] or [[The Game!/Combat\|Combat]]. It can be gained from being permanent additions to Skills by [[The Game!/Levelling Up\|Levelling Up]], from certain [[The Game!/Status Effects\|Status Effects]], eating specific meals, or having certain [[The Game!/Equipment\|Equipment]]. Advantage can also be given depending on the context surrounding whatever's being rolled: For instance, you may need to make a Reasoning check to solve a riddle, but you could be given an Advantage if you overheard the riddle beforehand. Multiple Advantages can be stacked at once, if they apply to the same roll. Making a Dexterity roll after eating a Healthy meal and having one Advantage checked on your [[The Game!/Character Creation\|Character Sheet]] mean you have an additional 2d6 to your roll.

The inverse to Advantage is Disadvantage, which removes a d6 from the relevant roll. Like Advantages, Disadvantages can stack, removing multiple dice from a roll if possible. 

If an Advantage and a Disadvantage are applied to the same roll, they are cancelled out. Think of it like combining a positive and negative number of equal value to get 0.
