The Communal Inventory is where your party can store their food for [[The Game!/Cooking\|Cooking]], any [[The Game!/Equipment\|Equipment]] that they are not currently using, Gold, or other special tools. It has a basically unlimited storage capacity, and is where your in-universe cooking equipment is located.
