Welcome to the rules doc (or I guess, site) for 5 Star Adventure! While the previous doc was a simple Google Docs page, I figured this would be a better way to update the rules of the game while keeping things organized and presentable!

5 Star Adventure is a Expansion-centric Cooking and Adventuring TTRPG, where your party can not only make a name for themselves as Adventurers, but also explore, fight, and cook whatever your heart desires!

A disclaimer: This game is still very much in development. If a section of the rules has a (!) following it, that means that the section is especially prone to updates, alterations, or additions.
