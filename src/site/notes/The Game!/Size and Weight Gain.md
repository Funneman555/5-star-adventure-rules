Size is your character's, well, size. Their mass. Their weight. Their surface area. Your character's size increases after eating a [[The Game!/Cooking\|meal]] that puts their current [[The Game!/Wellness & Fullness\|Fullness]] past their Max. Fullness. Every 6 Sizes, your character goes up a Stage. With each Stage, your character gains special benefits or downsides. Depending on your [[The Game!/Quirks\|Quirk]], your Stage might impact those as well.

# Losing Weight

There are two main ways to lose weight that don't involve outside tools like Spells or certain meals: Exercise and not eating. 

Exercise is performing any ATH roll with the Healthy Status Effect. Perform A Successful ATH roll or successfully win a combat encounter without taking damage with the Healthy Status Effect, and you go down a Size.

Whenever you perform an action, such as making a [[The Game!/Skills\|roll]], or engaging in [[The Game!/Combat\|Combat]], your current Fullness goes down by 1. If your Fullness is at 0 for 3 actions, then you gain the Hungry [[The Game!/Status Effects\|Status]]. Go 6 actions without eating, and you gain the Starving Status. When you're starving, any action afterwards when at a Fullness of 0 will make you go down a Size. 

If you're Immobile, then you instead roll 1d6 to struggle about until the physical exertion forces you to lose weight and go down Sizes equal to the number you rolled.
