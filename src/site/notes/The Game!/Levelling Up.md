Upon [[The Game!/Character Creation\|creating your character]], you'll find 5 blank checkboxes in the Experience section of your character sheet. This is your way of tracking your EXP until your next level.

Whenever you succeed in battle without sustaining injury, successfully cook a meal, or whatever other event the GM deems worthy, check a box. When all the boxes are filled, your character levels up. After your character levels up, remove the checks from the boxes, and add an additional box. 

Upon every Level Up, you can add one permanent advantage to any Non-Combat [[The Game!/Skills\|Skill]]. On every Even Numbered Level, you also gain a +2 to your Max. [[The Game!/Wellness & Fullness\|Wellness]]. On every Odd Numbered Level, you also can add one permanent advantage to a Combat Skill. At Level 5, you can choose a third [[The Game!/Quirks\|Quirk]] for your character, and a fourth at Level 8. The maximum Level that can be achieved is 10, when every possible checkbox is permanently filled.
