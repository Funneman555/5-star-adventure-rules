Quirks are the behaviors and habits that make your character unique to you. Quirks also have special, albeit situational properties attached to them, which can offer benefits, downsides, or even both, depending on the context. Below are a list of Quirks that you can select for your first Quirk in [[The Game!/Character Creation\|Character Creation]]. "ADV" means Advantage, and "-ADV" refers to Disadvantage.(!)
