This will be a comprehensive, step-by-step guide on creating Characters in 5 Star Adventure, specifically from Level 1.

Your character sheet should look something like this:

As you read this section, you'll come to understand what each aspect of this sheet means. A character, Vincent Van Papillon, will be made alongside each step as an example.

A brief disclaimer, the rules of the game are often at the discretion of the GM (Game Master), including mechanical relevance of certain items on the character sheet. 
# Step 1: Skill Selection

To create a character, select two skills out of the following list. These skills are the specialties of your character, and are grouped into color-coded pairs of two by type: Athletics (ATH), Intellect (INT), Heart (HRT), or Fortitude (FORT):
- **Dexterity (ATH)**: Reflexes, Balance, Stealth, Turn Order
- **Force (ATH)**: Pushing/Pulling Strength, Lifting, Brute Strength
- **Perception (INT)**: Awareness, Foraging, Insight
- **Reasoning (INT)**: Logic, Calculations, Estimations
- **Persuasion (HRT)**: Deception, Bargaining, Performance
- **Cooking (HRT)**: Culinary Skills, Spell Brewing, 
- **Constitution (FORT)**: Physical Resistance, Health
- **Willpower (FORT)**: Mental Resistance, Self-Control 

Next, select one skill out of these three. These Combat Skills are more geared towards combat:
- **Harm**: Capability to do damage
- **Finesse**: Grace, Coordination, overall efficiency
- **Safety**: Avoiding Risk, Ensuring your own wellbeing

(For our example, Vincent is an intelligent mage who aspires to be a great spellcaster, so we'll assign Perception and Cooking as his two skills. He's also pretty meek, so we'll assign his Combat Skill as Safety.)

By default, all skills are rolled with 2d6. Check a box in the "Advantage" section of the two skills you selected. With each box checked, you gain [[The Game!/Advantage\|Advantage]] on that skill, giving you an extra d6 to roll. You can have a maximum of 3 Advantage (ADV) stacked on a skill if the 3 boxes next to the Skill are checked, for a maximum dice pool of 5d6 without additional modifiers.Â 

Along with advantage, there is also [[The Game!/Advantage\|Disadvantage]] (-ADV), which removes a die from your dice pool. These happen as you accrue certain [[The Game!/Status Effects\|Status Effects]] or exist inside your character as a [[The Game!/Quirks\|Quirk]]. Speaking of which:

# Step 2: Picking Quirks

Quirks are the unique behaviors and habits that make your characters special. Every Quirk has an effect on how your character plays, some positive, some negative, and some may be both of those things. On the character sheet, there's room for 4 Quirks. The first quirk is selected from the pre-made list, which you'll find in the page for [[The Game!/Quirks\|Quirks]]. The second Quirk can either be from the list or an entirely unique one of your creation. Make sure to run it by your GM to keep things relatively balanced. The third and fourth Quirks can be acquired from [[The Game!/Levelling Up\|Levelling Up]], and can be either from the list or player-made.

(We'll be selecting both Quirks from the list. To keep in line with Vincent's character, he'll be getting the Nervous Wreck Quirk. He's also the type to get flustered when in the presence of someone much larger than him, so he'll be getting the "Fat-Distracted" Quirk.)

# Step 3: Favorite and Least Favorite Food

Every character has one Favorite and one Least Favorite Food. These tend to be specific flavors or dishes, rather than large groups of foods. These largely hold no direct mechanical benefit, but rather exist as a way to give your character some personal flair. Depending on your GM, they may include some kind of bonus or hinderance to Favorite/Least Favorite foods.

(Vincent loves a good cut of Breaded Chicken, but hates the texture and taste of Liver & Onions.)

# Step 4: Equipment

[[The Game!/Equipment\|Equipment]] in this context refers to the personal belongings of your character. On your sheet, you'll see three kinds of Equipment: Weapon, Armor, and Accessory. Your character can only hold one Weapon and Armor, and up to 3 Accessories at a time. When making a starting character, they have one Weapon and one Armor of your choice, although they are purely cosmetic, with no additional effects. Think of these as your character's "default" gear.

(Vincent dresses like a typical "mage", so their weapon would be their staff, and their armor a set of Scholarly Robes. Armor doesn't necessarily have to be protective gear, rather just whatever your character is wearing.)

# Step 5: Description

The Description of your character can be anything from a written description of what they look like, or even a picture! This is your chance to really give your character some depth, something that'll make them pop (figuratively).

(Feel free to be as descriptive as possible!)

# Step 6: Default Stats at Level 1

The remainder of the items on the sheet, that being [[The Game!/Wellness & Fullness\|Wellness & Fullness]], [[The Game!/Size and Weight Gain\|Size]], and [[The Game!/Levelling Up\|EXP]], are all set at Default values at Level 1:
- Max. Wellness is at 5. Max. Fullness is at 10. 
- Size starts anywhere from 1-5, at the Unhindered Stage.
- At Level 1, you should have 5 unfilled checkboxes in the "Experience" section.
Gold, or the amount of currency you have, can be at any value within reason, given the discretion of your GM .

And with that, the character sheet is complete!
