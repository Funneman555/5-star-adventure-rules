Status Effects are temporary special conditions that are applied to your character, which may provide rewards or downsides. 

A Status Effect has a duration attached to it, signified by a number on the rightmost side of the Status Effects section of your [[The Game!/Character Creation\|Character Sheet]]. Whenever you perform an action, be it [[The Game!/Cooking\|Cooking]], rolling [[The Game!/Skills\|Skills]], or engaging in [[The Game!/Combat\|Combat]], the number goes down by 1. Once the number goes down to 0, the Status is removed. These are called Temporary (Temp.) Statuses. Depending on the nature of these Statuses, the duration may be the result of a dice roll, or

in some cases, you may be afflicted with Status Effects that will persist until a specific condition is met. For example, a curse that can only be dispelled once you defeat the one who placed it. In these cases, an "X" would be written on the duration section of the status instead of the number. These are called Conditional (Cond.)Statuses

Below is a list of some frequent Status Effects you'll likely encounter.(!)
