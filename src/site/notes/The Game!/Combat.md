In 5 Star Adventure, Combat is meant to be lightweight (ha) and a secondary component of the game, rather than the focus. As a result, combat is merely a one turn system.

When combat is initiated, players can declare their actions at any point, with no pre-determined order other than what the players decide for themselves. Once every player declares their intent, they each roll against the GM. What the players roll depends on the nature of whatever action they've declared. If they use their weapon, then they roll the dice pool associated with that weapon, plus any permanent advantages on [[The Game!/Skills\|Skills]] like Harm. Or, for example, if they instead try to pickpocket the enemy in the middle of a fight, then it would be a Finesse roll. If they want to ensure their character's wellbeing or act defensively, then they roll for Safety.

These rolls will be opposed against the rolls of the opponent. If the player's roll is higher, then they are the victor of the encounter. If the enemy's roll is higher, then the player will succeed with some kind of drawback, be it a hit to their [[The Game!/Wellness & Fullness\|Wellness]], or some other downside. However, if the player's roll is equal to or higher than the enemy's roll by 5 points or less, then the player will succeed with some extra bonus. This could include some extra loot, or even the player getting to narrate their character's actions however they'd like. 

Take this for an example:

Vincent is attacked by a Cave Lizard!

- Vincent declares that he'll whack the lizard over the head with his staff!
	Vincent rolls 2d6 Harm: (3, 5) = 8
	
	The Cave Lizard makes it's roll, also 2d6: (5, 2) = 7
	
	Since Vincent's roll is only 1 higher than the Cave Lizard's, he not only successfully vanquishes the beast, but also gets some cuts of the lizard's meat for his trouble!

Enemies are nothing more than a dice pool to oppose the players. They could range anywhere from a 1d6 to a 6d6, or even more! This helps keep things simple for [[The Game!/GM's Discretion\|GMs]].
